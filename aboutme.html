        <h1>Who is Keara?</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Keara Allen. I was born in Utah and I have lived here my entire life. I am a mother to one
            amazing
            eight year old boy. Some hobbies of mine include refinishing furniture, resin crafts, reading, singing, and
            painting. I am a caring, empathetic, and goal driven person. For almost eight years I worked as a CNA in
            many
            different environments; long term care, drug and alcohol rehabilitation, short term rehabilitation, and in
            home
            services. I loved being a CNA and taking care of others but it is a taxing career, emotionally and
            physically.
            Earlier this year, 2023, I decided that it was time to find something new that I could enjoy and love as
            much as
            I loved being a CNA. That is when I decided to sign up for Tech Moms and see if I could find a place for me
            in
            Tech. There is still a lot for me to learn but I know that I will get there.
